metrics:
  Temperature_°C:
      description: |
        Optimal comfort for most activities is between 20–24°C.
        Below 18°C may feel too cold for comfort, while above 26°C may be too warm.
  co2_ppm:
      description: |
        Levels below 600 ppm are ideal for maintaining focus and preventing drowsiness.
        Levels between 600–800 ppm are acceptable for short durations but may reduce alertness.
        Above 1000 ppm may cause discomfort and reduced cognitive performance.
  Illumination_lx:
      description: |
        Optimal illumination for reading and studying is between 300–500 lx.
        Levels below 200 lx may be too dim and cause eye strain, while above 750 lx may cause glare.
  Humidity_%:
      description: |
        Comfortable humidity levels range from 30–50%.
        Levels below 30% can cause dry skin and discomfort, while above 60% may lead to a muggy environment and promote mold growth.
  occupancy_count:
      description: |
        Indicates the number of people present in the room.
        Higher occupancy can affect air quality and noise levels, potentially reducing comfort and focus.
  spl_A:
      description: |
        Sound levels measured in A-weighted decibels (dB(A)).
        For a quiet study environment, levels below 35 dB(A) are ideal.
        Prolonged exposure to levels above 55 dB(A) can disrupt concentration.
  voc_ppb:
      description: |
        Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) levels below 200 ppb are considered good.
        Levels between 200–500 ppb may indicate the presence of potential pollutants.
        Consistently high levels (above 1000 ppb) can pose health risks.
  pm2.5_μg/m3:
      description: |
        Particulate matter (PM2.5) levels should be below 12 μg/m³ for good air quality.
        Levels between 12–35 μg/m³ are moderate, but prolonged exposure may cause health concerns.
        Levels above 35 μg/m³ indicate poor air quality and potential respiratory risks.
  pm10.0_μg/m3:
      description: |
        Particulate matter (PM10) levels should be below 20 μg/m³ for good air quality.
        Levels between 20–50 μg/m³ are moderate but may affect sensitive groups.
        Levels above 50 μg/m³ indicate poor air quality and may impact health.
  motion_last_minute:
      description: |
        Indicates movement detected within the last minute.
        Can be used to assess activity levels, security, or room utilization.
        A high count suggests significant motion, while zero indicates stillness.
