Questions and Answers:
  Q: Compare to traditional booking systems, how do you like this one?
  A: The system is a good idea, and I appreciate how it truly understands my needs. It not only provided me with a room that had good lighting as I requested, but also took into account factors I didn’t explicitly mention, like the room's quietness, and recommended a relatively quiet space. However, when we went to the room ranked as 1, we found that it was occupied, so we had to use the room ranked as 2 instead. While traditional booking systems also lack this feature, it would be very convenient if the system could detect whether a room is currently in use in real-time. Adding such functionality would save users time and enhance the overall experience.
  Q: Any feedback and suggestions?
  A: The system could benefit from better visualization, such as including images or a floor plan for each room. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, it would be even better if the system could include a real-time update feature to show the current occupancy status of rooms. This addition would greatly enhance convenience and save users time when making decisions.

Questions and Answers:
  Q: Compare to traditional booking systems, how do you like this one?
  A: This system is quite innovative and convenient. It’s amazing how I can simply type a natural language request, and it understands exactly what I need. The ranked suggestions save a lot of time compared to manually filtering through options in traditional booking systems. However, it could be improved with a few additional features, like displaying photos of the rooms or real-time availability. Overall, I think it’s a significant improvement.
  Q: Any feedback and suggestions?
  A: I’d suggest adding more detailed information about the rooms, such as photos and dimensions. Another useful addition would be a real-time availability feature, which would help users make quicker decisions. Also, integrating user reviews or feedback for each room would make the recommendations more reliable.
